        <h1 id="welcome">Welcome</h1>
        <h3>Spaghetto is a simple, c-like, interpreted programming language not specialized in anything really.</h3>
        Spaghetto files uses the .spag extension, but you can also run code using the CLI.<br><br>

        <h2 id="gettingStarted">Getting Started</h2>
        To start using Spaghetto, you are gonna have to <a href="https://github.com/GoldenretriverYT/spaghetto/releases/latest">download the latest release</a> or download <a href="https://github.com/GoldenretriverYT/spaghetto/">the repository</a> and build it yourself.
        The downloaded file will be in the zip format, extract to to where you want. Inside your new folder, there should be a spaghettoCLI.exe file. Run it to open the CLI interpreter (run code quickly in the console).

        <br><h2 id="vt">Value types</h2>
        Spaghetto is a language where everything is an object - from class definitions to functions; they are just an "SValue" object too. To create strings, use the string literal syntax <code>"my string"</code>. You can use ints or floats in your calculations, if you want to use a float your number needs to be a fully qualified decimal number (<code>3.0</code>)
        
        <br><h2 id="comments">Comments</h2>
        Spaghetto supports single-line comments. They use the same syntax as in many languages by starting with <code>//</code>.

        <br><h2 id="variables">Variables</h2>
        To define a variable, you use <code>var myVar = &lt;value&gt;</code>. This will define the variable myVar in the current "context" (function context, global context, etc.).
        To change your variables value at a later time, do <code>myVar = &lt;newValue&gt;;</code>. Note that variables are fixed-type by default, which means that a
        different type can not be assigned after initilization; to change that you can use the <code>var%</code> syntax which makes your variable free-typed.
        Spaghetto also offers support for constant variables using the <code>const var myVar = &lt;value&gt;</code> - these can not be changed after initilization.

        <br><h2 id="semicolons">Semicolons</h2>
        In Spaghetto, semicolons are purely optional but recommended.

        <br><h2 id="functions">Functions</h2>
        Spaghetto supports functions like almost every other language does too.
        <code class="fullWidth">
            import native lang; // We need to import the native library 'lang' here to use the list.length function<br>
            <br>
            func calcAvg(lst) {<br>
            &emsp;var sum = 0;<br>
            <br>
            &emsp;repeat!(list.length(lst) times) {<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;sum = sum + lst#i;<br>
            &emsp;}<br>
            <br>
            &emsp;return sum / list.length(lst);<br>
            }
        </code><br><br>

        This code will define a new function called <i>calcAvg</i>, which can be called by using calcAvg([3, 2, 6, 2, 4, 0]) or with whatever list you want to use. It returns the average value of the lists entries as int.
    
        <br><h2 id="imports">Imports</h2>
        As seen above, you can import native libraries and normal files. Those two have a slightly different syntax as shown here:
        <code class="fullWidth">
            import native lang; // A native import features the "native" keyword and then an identifier.<br>
            import "myfile.spag"; // File imports do not have the extra keyword and they need a string literal instead of an identifier.<br>
        </code><br><br>

        <br><h2 id="imports">Control flow</h2>
        Spaghetto supports if/else/elseif. Switches are not supported yet.
        <code class="fullWidth">
            import native io; // adds println func<br><br>

            if(x == 3 || x == 2) <br>
            &emsp;println("ok"); // that works too<br>
            else if(x == 1) {<br>
            &emsp;println("well thats not so ok");<br>
            } else {<br>
            &emsp;println("something went completely wrong!");<br>
            }<br>
        </code><br><br>

        <br><h2 id="loops">Loops</h2>
        Spaghetto supports for and while loops, but also so-called "repeat" loops
        
        <br><h3 id="loopsFor">For</h3>
        For loops work basically the same way they do in most C-like languages.

        <code class="fullWidth">
            import native io; // adds println func<br><br>

            for(var i = 0; i < 100; i++) { <br>
            &emsp;if(i % 3 == 0) continue; // Dont print every third number<br>
            &emsp;if(i == 33) break; // Stop at 33<br>
            <br>
            &emsp;println(i);<br>
            }
        </code>

        <div class="actual-warning fullWidth">Note: Using for loops for repeation tasks with no special conditions (= no breaks or continues either) is not recommended as there is a faster alternative.</div>

        <br><h3 id="loopsFor">While</h3>
        While loops are also identical to other C-like languages

        <code class="fullWidth">
            import native io; // adds println func<br><br>

            while(1) {
                println("muhahaha");
            }
        </code>

        <br><h3 id="loopsFor">Repeat</h3>
        Repeat is a special loop as it is made for performance. It gets rid of the overhead through calling a condition which gets converted to a bool and the check if we should continue or break and blablabla. You get the point. There are two different versions of the repeat loop, <code>repeat</code> and <code>repeat!</code>.<br>
        The difference between those two is easy:<br>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <code>repeat</code> creates a new scope for every cycle, which means that variables defined within the repeat block are not accessible outside of the block
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>repeat!</code> does NOT create a new scope for every cycle, which improves performance to be near native C# performance (without any body obviously)
            </li>
        </ul>

        You can not use break; or continue; in those loops, they would try to affect the outer loop (if there is one)

        <code class="fullWidth">
            import native io; // adds print func<br><br>

            repeat(100 times) {<br>
                &emsp;var x = 30; // this works fine here<br>
                &emsp;print("ok ");<br>
            }<br>
            <br>
            repeat!(100 times) {<br>
                &emsp;var x = 30; // this will throw an exception as we try to initilize the variable multiple times.<br>
                &emsp;print("ok ");<br>
            }<br>
        </code>

        
    </div>
