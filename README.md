# Spaghetto
Spaghetto is a simple interpreted language with an interpreter written in C#

> **Warning**<br>
> Spaghetto is slow, tends to crash and hasn't been worked on for a while. Please do not use this in serious software.

## Why use Spaghetto?
Honestly, you shouldn't. It is just a fun project I do in my free time. It isn't really good, stable or quick. Its slower than python. Worse than COBOL (ok thats maybe over exaggerated). Has more bugs than Cyberpunk 2077.

## How do I use Spaghetto?
Download the latest release and extract it. Run spaghetto.exe (you might need to install .NET 6.0 first). This will open a command prompt allowing you to enter single line
Spaghetto instructions. To run multi-line instructions, use the run(path: String) command.

## Documentation
Coming soon, whilst the docs are work in progress, you can check the examples in [/spaghetto/examples/](https://github.com/GoldenretriverYT/spaghetto/tree/main/spaghetto/examples)

## Credits
The core of this language is based on [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eythq9848Fg) as I would have been to stupid to do this properly otherwise (like seriously, look at [PoopScript](https://github.com/GoldenretriverYT/PoopScript) to see what a mess I used to make)

(this is not implying that this one is good lmao, it really isnt)
