# Spaghetto
Spaghetto is a simple interpreted language with an interpreter written in C#

## V2
V2 is a new iteration of spaghetto, written completely from scratch. The syntax has been slightly changed to allow for easier and better parsing whilst maintaining an easy to use syntax. V2 aims to be faster, less buggy and more usable. Also, I am planning to never use Reflection within this project so that it stays compatible with COSMOS, if that isn't possible in the long run, I will probably create a cosmos-compat branch at some point.



More information soon
